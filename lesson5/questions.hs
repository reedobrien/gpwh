-- Q5.1 Now that you know about partial application, you no longer need to use
-- genIfEvenX. Redefine ifEvenInc, ifEvenDouble, and ifEvenSquare by using
-- ifEven and partial application.
ifEven f x = if even x
             then f x
             else x

inc x = x + 1
double x = x * 2
square x = x ^ 2

ifEvenInc = ifEven inc
ifEvenDouble = ifEven double
ifEvenSquare = ifEven square


-- Q5.2 Even if Haskell didnâ€™t have partial application, you could hack
-- together some approximations. Following a similar pattern to flipBinaryArgs
-- (figure 5.6), write a function binaryPartialApplication that takes
-- a binary function and one argument and returns a new function waiting for
-- the missing argument.
binaryPartialApplication f x = (\y -> f x y)

add5To = binaryPartialApplication (+) 5
